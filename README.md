# Animated Countdown

## Description
This project is a simple animated countdown timer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The animation counts down from 3 to 0, displays a "GO" message, and provides a "Replay" button to restart the countdown.

## Features
- Animated countdown from 3 to 0
- Smooth transitions using CSS animations
- A final message displayed after the countdown
- A "Replay" button to restart the countdown
  
## Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## File Structure
```
project-folder/
│── index.html  # Main HTML file
│── style.css   # Styling file
│── script.js   # JavaScript file

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. The countdown will automatically start.
3. After the countdown ends, a "GO" message appears.
4. Click the "Replay" button to restart the countdown.

## How It Works
- The `script.js` file controls the animation logic.
